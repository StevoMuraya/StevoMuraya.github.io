                Life Is Spiritual Publishing Company LTD (LIS) is a publishing
                company working with a non-denominational christian discipleship
                youth ministry under Faith Christian Fellowship Kenya
                www.fcfkenya.com. FCF-Kenya has a goal to see the gospel of the
                Kingdom of God spread to the entire world. This ministry was
                founded by Apostle Timsimon "Bamboo" Kimani and prophetess Erica
                Kimani.

                Tim is married to Erica Mukisa Kimani and is a family man and a
                man of God. We believe that there are many deep and wonderful
                truths hidden in the bible which God's children need to know.
                Unfortunately, many of these truths are not revealed by the
                mainstream christian church through televangelists because of
                the level of compromise and infiltration of the enemy into
                positions of media leadership.

                Therefore the enemy is able to conceal many of his deceptions to
                the world because his agents are some of the popular ministers
                with access to the world through the media. Now there are many
                men of God who have not been compromised however, these men seem
                to have no voice or have been silenced before they could reach
                many souls in the world with the truth.

                The body of Christ needs their own platforms where the evil arms
                of censorship and/or infiltration cannot reach. Satan's kingdom
                is a kingdom of darkness. Darkness is ignorance, therefore
                Satan's kingdom thrives on the ignorance of humanity. The more a
                born again human being declares the light of God's word, the
                less space the devil has to move around. Matthew 5:14 "Ye are
                the light of the world, a city that is set on a hill cannot be
                hid." These were Yeshuah's (Jesus) words to his disciples. A
                light must reveal truth. The kind of truth that makes one
                dangerous to the kingdom of darkness is the truth which reveals
                and exposes their secrets, their plans and their purposes.

                Light is what will destroy Satan's kingdom. Yeshuah is that
                light. The light of God's word and the revealing of Satan's
                operations is a key which the body of Christ must use to our
                advantage. If this generation knew what they were up against,
                they would be more loyal to God than they were to the devil.
                This ministry exists to reveal truth, dangerous truth. The kind
                of truth which Satan and his minions do NOT want God's children
                to know.

                This ministry will continue to release various publications such
                as the "Erica" series with a view to feed God's children with as
                much information as possible so as to equip them for the days
                ahead. We are in the last of the last days. We are the
                circumcision, who worship God in spirit, we rejoice in Christ
                Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh (Phil 3:3). May God
                bless your journey, and thank you for stopping by and remember,
